# Udemy-HTML-CSS-Course
I created this website while taking "Web Design for Beginners: Real World Coding in HTML &amp; CSS" on Udemy by Brad Schiff. Most of it was written while following the videos, but some are created by me using the concepts that I learned.

The file for the home page is [index.html](https://github.com/21david/Udemy-HTML-CSS-Course/blob/main/index.html)
